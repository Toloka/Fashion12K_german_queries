# Fashion12K German Queries dataset

To create Fashion12K German Queries dataset we sampled 12k images from  [Fashion200K dataset](https://github.com/xthan/fashion-200k) and annotated them with German and English queries using [Toloka](https://toloka.ai/).

Each row in the dataset consists of three entries:

- image url (link to s3 bucket where the original image is hosted),
- English query,
- German query.
